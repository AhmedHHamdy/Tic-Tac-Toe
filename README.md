# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to play against the AI, which uses a simple algorithm to determine its moves.

## How It&#39;s Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is a 3x3 grid of clickable squares, with the player's and AI's moves represented by X's and O's interchangeably. The AI's move is determined by a simple algorithm that checks for winning moves and blocks the player's winning moves. The game also includes a reset button to start a new game. The design was created using CSS, with a minimalist and modern aesthetic.

## Future Optimizations

To optimize the game, I could implement a caching system that stores the game state in local storage. This would allow users to return to their game even if they close or refresh their browser. Additionally, I should optimize the AI algorithm to make the game more challenging by adding a higher level of difficulty that uses a more complex algorithm to determine the AI's moves.

## Lessons Learned:

While building this project, I learned a lot about working with JavaScript and algorithms. I gained a better understanding of how to structure code for a game, how to implement logic for an AI opponent, I also learned about the importance of testing and debugging, and how to effectively use the console to find and fix errors.
